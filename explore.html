            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
            down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. We also have the
            Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00
            and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team
            of experts. During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs
            where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of
            discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out
            more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
            places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more
            about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students
            through for a visit.
